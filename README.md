# AwesomeML
Building and Distributing Packages in Python using Conda Framework

In this workshop, we will go through the basics of building and distributing python packages.
We will focus on machine learning codes, e.g., a new classifier, and we will take it all the way
from a just a python script to a maintainable and installable package.

In order to set up for the first time, clone this repository:
```commandline
git clone git@github.com:kamran-haider/AwesomeML.git
cd AwesomeML
cd notebooks
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate workshop
jupyter notebook 
```
Open the `ml_packaging_workshop.ipynb` and try to recreate the `AwesomeML` package following the 
tutorial. 

Feel free to send suggestions to improve this at `kamranhaider.mb@gmail.com`.
